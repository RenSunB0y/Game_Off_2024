  - "Wait\u2026 ?! This is but a list of provisions for the monks. My apologies,
    I judged this too quickly."
  - 'Yet let this serve as a warning: you must exercise great care.'
  - I expect you to do at least 5 documents by the sunset each day.
  - Then you pull the cord and only then, if you have finished I will let you go
    before the end of the day.
  - BUT DO NOT STAY WHEN ITS NIGHT! NEVER! You should always been gone before the
    night. I will come check myself.
  - Well, I believe we have covered all for today. Return tomorrow morn, at the same
    hour.
